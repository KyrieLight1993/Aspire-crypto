		  <p>We are building the cryptoeconomy – a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system enabled by crypto. We started in 2021 with the radical idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin. Today, we offer a trusted and easy-to-use platform for practising the broader cryptoeconomy. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A cryptocurrency’s blockchain is the master public ledger that records and stores all prior transactions and activity, validating ownership of all units of the currency at any given point in time.</p>
		  <p>The idea for cryptocurrency first began in the late 1980’s, the idea was for a currency that could be sent untraceably and in a manner that did not require centralized entities (i.e. Banks). In 1995, American cryptographer David Chaum implemented an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called Digicash. It was an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software to withdraw from a bank and required specific encrypted keys before it could be sent to a recipient. Bit Gold, often called a direct precursor to Bitcoin, was designed in 1998 by Nick Szabo. It required a participant to dedicate computer power to solving cryptographic puzzles, and those who solved the puzzle received the reward. If you put Chaum’s and Szabo’s concepts together, then you have something that resembles Bitcoin.</p>
		  <p>It’s true that the source codes and technical controls that support and secure cryptocurrencies are highly complex. However, laypeople are more than capable of understanding the basic concepts and becoming informed cryptocurrency users. Blockchain has the potential to grow to be a bedrock of the worldwide record-keeping systems, but was launched just 10 years ago. It was created by the unknown persons behind the online cash currency bitcoin, under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto In 2009, the so-called Satoshi Nakamoto a person whose identity is still secret, created the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. As you have already read, he was not the first person who came up with the idea to create it. What was the intention behind it? To create a new way of payment that could be used internationally, decentralized and without having any financial institution behind it. While it wasn’t the first online currency to be proposed, the bitcoin proposal solved several problems in the field and has been by far the most successful version. The engine that runs the bitcoin ledger that Nakamoto designed is called the blockchain; the original and largest blockchain is the one that still orchestrates bitcoin transactions today.</p>
